Both as an attacker and defender, it's important to understand how different pieces of software work. Often times that means building mock, smaller versions of what you're attacking/defending. The GSMST Alumni website runs on the Django python framework, being served behind a nginx reverse proxy. Review both the code on the internal git repository (https://git.habitual-media.com/habitual/alumni_site), django's documentation, and nginx documentation. Then build a small mock django web server where you can test potential attacks/vulns. Even outside of actual attacks and vulnerabilities, even identifying inefficiencies can benefit defensive posture, as it prevents avenues for DDOS.
